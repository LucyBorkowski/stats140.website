I’m Lucy Borkowski, a fourth year undergraduate Statistics & Data Science student at UCLA. I’m passionate about statistical modeling, computational methods, and using data to understand real-world problems. Through my coursework and projects, I’ve gained experience in regression, linear models, simulation, optimization, and statistical programming in both R and C++.

Outside of academics, I’m involved in Bruin Belles and BruinXR, where I’ve had the chance to take on leadership and outreach roles. I also love traveling, playing soccer, exploring new languages, and finding ways to make a positive impact in my community.
