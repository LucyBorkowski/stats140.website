## Introduction

This study investigates how biological stress responses vary by type of physical activity, and whether these responses are moderated by age and gender in an Islander population. Key questions include:

- Are there gender differences in physical endurance?  
- Does age correlate with physical endurance in high-exertion tasks (e.g., swimming)?  
- Are elevated blood hormone (adrenaline and cortisol) levels associated with increased physical activity?  
- Does type of physical activity influence stress hormone responses?  

## Background & Existing Literature

- **Cortisol and Adrenaline as Coordinated Stress Hormones:** Cortisol regulates energy metabolism, immune function, and exercise adaptation, while adrenaline supports immediate energy and cardiovascular output (Hackney & Walz, 2013).  
- **Exercise Intensity and Cortisol Response:** Moderate to high intensity exercise (≥60% VO2 max) significantly elevates cortisol; low-intensity exercise (≈40%) produces minimal hormonal response (Hill et al., 2008).  
- **Physical Activity and Hormonal Health:** Regular exercise reduces cortisol and improves sleep quality; most research is clinical, focusing on women with health conditions (De Nys et al., 2022).  
- **Age-Related Decline in Physical Activity:** Physical activity decreases by 40–80% with age, increasing chronic disease risk and altering stress hormone responses (Suryadinata et al., 2020).  
- **Gender Differences in Endurance:** Men generally have higher VO2max, while women excel in pacing, fat utilization, and fatigue resistance (Besson et al., 2022).  

## Methods

### Participants

- N = 90 healthy individuals from the Islander population  
- Balanced by **gender** (45 males, 45 females) and **age groups** (0–25, 26–50, 51+)  

### Experimental Design

- Open-label, **three-way between-subjects factorial design**  
- **Independent Variables:**  
  - Exercise Type: Bungee Jumping, Swimming, Light Jogging  
  - Age Group: 0–25, 26–50, 51+  
  - Gender: Male, Female  
- **Dependent Variables:**  
  - Change in **adrenaline**, **cortisol**, and **blood oxygen levels** (post-pre)  
- 18 total groups (2 genders × 3 age groups × 3 activities)  
- 5 participants per group to maintain balanced design  

### Procedure

- Participants completed one of the three exercises  
- Blood samples collected **before and after exercise**  
- Physiological changes computed for stress markers and oxygen levels  

### Sample Size Determination

- Power = 0.80, α = 0.05, effect size = 0.40  
- Minimum N = 74 (G*Power)  
- Final N = 90 to ensure balanced groups and independence  

### Data Analysis

- Three-way ANOVA to assess **main effects** and **interactions** of Exercise Type, Age, and Gender  
- Post-hoc comparisons via **Tukey HSD**  
- Visual diagnostics with **Residual and Q-Q plots**  

## Results

### ANOVA & MANOVA

- **Gender significantly influenced stress responses:**  
  - Adrenaline change (p = 0.002)  
  - Cortisol change (p = 0.036)  
- **Age effects** were not significant  
- **Age × Gender interaction** not significant  
- Blood oxygen levels remained stable across groups  

### Post-Hoc Analysis

- Tukey HSD: Significant gender differences in adrenaline levels (p = 0.002)  
- Females exhibited **higher post-swimming adrenaline**, especially in age groups 0–25 and 51+  

### Diagnostics

- Residual and Q-Q plots indicated model assumptions largely met  
- No major violations observed  

## Conclusions

- **Gender is a stronger determinant** of physiological stress response than age in high-exertion activities  
- **Swimming elicited higher adrenaline responses in females** across age groups  
- Age does not significantly modify cortisol, adrenaline, or oxygen response in this population  
- High-intensity exercise in Islander populations highlights gender-specific adaptations in stress physiology
