## Project Overview

This project develops a statistical modeling framework to quantify how key socioeconomic and well-being indicators influence healthy life expectancy across countries. Using international data from the Gallup World Poll, sourced through the *World Happiness Report* (143 observations), the analysis investigates whether happiness levels, economic conditions, and perceived government corruption can serve as reliable predictors of population health outcomes.

## Technical Approach

We implemented a multiple linear regression framework to model **healthy life expectancy** as a function of three predictors:

- **Happiness Score** (1–10)  
- **Economic Well-Being** (GDP per capita index)  
- **Perceptions of Corruption** (public trust metric)

Initial exploratory analysis showed positive correlations between life expectancy and both happiness and GDP per capita, while corruption showed no meaningful linear relationship. Skewness and several influential observations motivated a transformation-based modeling approach.

To address violations of normality and heteroscedasticity, we applied **Box–Cox power transformations** to the response and predictors. Model diagnostics indicated that individualized transformations significantly improved fit. Variable-selection procedures (Adjusted R², AIC/AICc, BIC, and added-variable plots) identified **perceptions of corruption** as a non-significant predictor and it was removed from the final specification.

## Final Model

The optimized model estimates transformed healthy life expectancy as a function of transformed GDP per capita and happiness score:

\[
(\text{Healthy Life Expectancy})^{1.43} = -0.0087 + 0.235 (\text{Economy})^2 + 0.038 (\text{Happiness Score})^2
\]

The final model explains 72.35% of the variance in healthy life expectancy (\(R^2 = 0.7235\)) and is statistically significant (ANOVA \(p < 0.05\)). Both remaining predictors show strong statistical significance and positive effects.

## Key Findings

- Economic prosperity and subjective well-being are strong, quantifiable drivers of healthy life expectancy.  
- Perceived corruption does not meaningfully predict life expectancy within this dataset.  
- The results highlight potential policy levers — improvements in economic conditions and well-being metrics may translate into measurable health gains.  

## Limitations & Future Work

- The study notes potential omitted-variable bias, sensitivity to outliers, and limited generalizability due to the concentration of upper-middle-income countries in the dataset.  
- Future extensions include expanding the feature set, applying the model to additional years, and validating performance across more diverse global populations.
