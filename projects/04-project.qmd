## Introduction

Hurricanes form over warm ocean waters when heat and moisture cause rising air, creating low pressure. As air continues to rise and rotate, storms intensify.  

- Lower central pressure → stronger winds  
- Hurricanes are ranked **Category 1–5** based on sustained wind speed  
- Predicting which storms will become major hurricanes (Category 3–5) is crucial for emergency planning and saving lives  

## Research Question

To what extent can early meteorological measurements—**wind speed, central pressure, and storm location**—predict whether a tropical hurricane will intensify into a major hurricane?  
- Which variables are most significant in category prediction?

## Data & Methodology

### Important Variables

- **Pressure:** Lower central pressure indicates stronger storm  
- **Wind Speed:** Direct measure of intensity  
- **Track Coordinates (latitude/longitude):** Storm behavior differs by region  
- **Date:** Seasonal cycles influence intensity  
- **Category:** Classification based on maximum sustained wind  
- **Naming Status:** Named storms often reach higher intensity and are monitored more closely  

### Data Cleaning

- Started with ~13,665 storm observations  
- Removed missing or impossible values (e.g., pressure = 0, wind = 0)  
- Feature engineered:  
  - `category` from max wind  
  - `region` from coordinates  
  - `hemisphere` from storm ID  
- Final cleaned dataset: ~12,674 observations  

## Initial Exploratory Analysis

- Visualized distributions of pressure, wind speed, and category  
- Explored spatial patterns across latitudes and regions  
- Examined seasonal trends in intensification  

## Modeling

### Model 1: Logistic Regression (Main Effects)

- Predictors: wind speed, pressure, latitude, longitude, region  
- AIC: 12,435; AUC: 0.797  
- Threshold 0.5: major hurricane classification ~48%, non-major ~92.7%  
- Optimal threshold from ROC = 0.336 → balanced accuracy = 0.712  
- Key insights: Lower pressure & higher wind early → higher odds of major hurricane  
- Limitation: Under-predicts major hurricanes → nonlinear/interaction effects missed  

### Model 2: Logistic Regression with Interaction Terms

- Added interactions: wind × pressure, wind × latitude  
- AIC dropped to 12,138; AUC = 0.8055  
- Optimal threshold = 0.3091  
- Major hurricane classification improved from 64% → 67%  
- Balanced accuracy = 0.731  
- Key takeaway: Interactions capture conditional meteorological effects  

### Model 3: Random Forest

- Predictors: wind speed, pressure, latitude, longitude, region  
- Motivation: Capture nonlinear patterns & complex interactions missed by logistic regression  
- Classification performance:  
  - Major hurricanes: 81.8%  
  - Non-major: 85%  
- AUC = 0.911 → substantial improvement over logistic regression  

### Model 4: Random Forest with Interaction Features

- Added engineered interactions from logistic regression Model 2  
- Captured complex conditional effects  
- Performance:  
  - Major hurricanes: 76.6%  
  - Non-major: 85.8%  
  - AUC = 0.8994 (slightly lower than simpler RF)  
- RF already incorporates interactions → added terms slightly redundant  

## Results & Analysis

- **Best performing model:** Random Forest (Model 3)  
- **Most influential predictors:**  
  - Wind speed (high wind → higher intensification odds)  
  - Central pressure (low pressure → higher intensification odds)  
- **Predictive accuracy:** ~82% for major hurricanes  
- **AUC:** 0.91 → model reliably separates major vs non-major hurricanes  
- Early meteorological measurements can predict major hurricane potential with strong confidence  

## Feature & Model Limitations

- Some meteorological factors (e.g., sea surface temperature, humidity) unavailable  
- Older storm data may be less accurate due to technological limitations  
- Class imbalance: major hurricanes less common → potential skew in models  
- Data cleaning may introduce selection bias (removing missing/impossible values)  
- Logistic regression struggled with nonlin
