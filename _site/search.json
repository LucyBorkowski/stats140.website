Skewness and several influential observations motivated a transformation-based modeling approach.\nTo address violations of normality and heteroscedasticity, we applied Box–Cox power transformations to the response and predictors. Model diagnostics indicated that individualized transformations significantly improved fit. Variable-selection procedures (Adjusted R², AIC/AICc, BIC, and added-variable plots) identified perceptions of corruption as a non-significant predictor and it was removed from the final specification."
